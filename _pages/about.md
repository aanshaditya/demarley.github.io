Welcome to my personal website!

I am a particle physicist working on the CMS experiment.
Currently, I work at the Fermilab LPC and specialize in 
applying machine learning techniques to precision measurements of top quarks.
I live with my wife and our two dogs in NW Indiana.

If you're interested, feel free to have a look at my GitHub page 
[here](https://github.com/demarley) 
where you can view some of my projects.  
In particular, the [figment](https://github.com/demarley/figment) 
project highlights some of my exploration into data science and kaggle challenges through Jupyter notebooks.

For more info, please contact me via email or create an issue
in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/demarley/demarley.github.io).
