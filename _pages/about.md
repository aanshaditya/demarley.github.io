Welcome to my personal website!

I am a particle physicist working on the CMS experiment.
Currently, I work at the Fermilab LPC and specialize in 
applying machine learning techniques to precision measurements of top quarks.
I live with my wife and our two dogs in NW Indiana -- just outside of Chicago.

For more info, please contact me via email or create an issue
in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/demarley/demarley.github.io).
